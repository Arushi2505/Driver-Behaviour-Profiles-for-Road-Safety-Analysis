# Driver-Behaviour-Profiles-for-Road-Safety-Analysis
## Introduction
This project investigates driver behavior profiling
 for road safety analysis using accelerometer and gyrometer
 data. Through visualization-based exploratory data analysis,
 data cleansing, and advanced processing techniques, insights
 into the datasetâ€™s characteristics and relationships are gained.
 Future work includes model development and deployment for
 real-world road safety applications.
